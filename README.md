# WSB-Trading Analytics Platform

## Features
- Institutional-grade analytics for stocks and crypto
- Real-time and historical data from Alpha Vantage, CoinGecko, and TradingView
- Machine learning models (Prophet, ARIMA, LSTM) for forecasting
- Automated price alerts (thresholds and advanced moving average cross)
- Multi-channel notifications (email, Discord, push, Slack, Telegram, SMS) ‚Äî configurable per user or for all users
- Visual alert history and triggered events log
- Interactive dashboard: widgets and charts for all data sources

## Advanced Alerts
- **Price Threshold**: Get notified when price crosses above/below a set value
- **Moving Average Cross**: Get notified when a short MA crosses above/below a long MA (configurable)
- Alerts can be configured for stocks (Alpha Vantage) and crypto (CoinGecko)
- Alerts can notify all users or only the creator (configurable)

## Visual Alert History
- All triggered alerts are logged and can be viewed in the dashboard
- Alert history includes timestamp, asset, type, price, message, and notified users

## Multi-User & Notification Integration
- Notification settings are user-configurable
- Alerts can be set to notify all users or specific users
- Backend is structured for future expansion to persistent user management

## üõ†Ô∏è Backend Alert Logic & API

The backend price alert system is implemented in TypeScript with clear modularity and verbose documentation. See:
- `server/src/alerts/priceAlertScheduler.ts`: Main alert scheduler, polling, and notification logic. **Now includes verbose docstrings and comments for all alert types (price, MA cross, RSI, MACD, ADX, etc.)**
- `server/src/routes/price_alerts.ts`: Express API routes for CRUD, status, and testing of price alerts. **Now fully documented with endpoint docstrings and inline explanations.**

### Example: Adding an ADX Alert
```json
{
  "type": "adx",
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "highs": [/* ... */],
  "lows": [/* ... */],
  "history": [/* closes ... */],
  "period": 14,
  "threshold": 25,
  "direction": "above",
  "notify": { "email": "user@example.com" }
}
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/price-alerts` ‚Äî List all alerts
- `GET /api/price-alerts/status` ‚Äî Status for each alert (symbol, type, threshold, direction)
- `GET /api/price-alerts/history` ‚Äî Recent alert events
- `POST /api/price-alerts` ‚Äî Add a new alert (see above JSON)
- `DELETE /api/price-alerts/:idx` ‚Äî Remove alert by index
- `POST /api/price-alerts/test/:idx` ‚Äî Simulate/trigger alert for testing

### Alert Structure
See `server/src/alerts/priceAlertScheduler.ts` for the full `PriceAlert` and `User` interface documentation. All notification fields and supported indicators are described inline.

## üìù Development Notes
- All backend alert logic is now **modular, extensible, and fully documented**.
- To add new indicators, extend the logic in `priceAlertScheduler.ts` and update the API route as needed.
- For advanced usage (multi-condition alerts, broadcast to all users, etc.), see the docstrings and comments in the scheduler file.

## üìö Documentation
- All major backend modules and API endpoints now include verbose comments and docstrings for easy onboarding and extension.
- For roadmap, see `MEMORY[0fab6083-99d7-4a66-965a-ee955bbb8877]` (recommendations for indicators, modularity, and UI/UX).

## üöÄ Quickstart
1. `cd wsb-trading/server && npm install && npm start` (backend)
2. `cd wsb-trading/client && npm install && npm start` (frontend)
3. Use the API or UI to add, test, and monitor price alerts!
